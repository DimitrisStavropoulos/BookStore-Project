In BookController

1) Edit [Post] gets a BookEditViewModel
-same as BookViewModel without SelectList(Author/Genre/Publisher)
-these are populated by method PopulateAllDropDownLists 
-edit brings preselected values for dropdowns during Create action
-Create [post] gets a BookViewModel as before.
-Made tests with Create then Edit. No Bind problems whatsoever. 
Everything looks ok in browser and database. 
-We could use just one viewmodel for create and edit but there are other things to worry about
 so we'll leave it as it is.
2) In Book Views FORGET ABOUT PARTIAL VIEWS. We will not use them. 
3) Q:Savvas (Book Index view). Why do I see .First() is it necessary?  
4) Leave Book Delete Action/Views as they are for the moment, using a Book Model.
5) Todo IF we have time, ONLY AFTER we do the important stuff:
  Smaller stuff: sort order needs to start from book title alphabetically, after that whatever you want
			   : combined book index filtering by genre/author, it's tricky so we' ll leave for last.
			   : see if you can get rid of genreId,PublisherId,AuthorId tags in create/edit view.
			    (it's because we are passing select lists through viewmodels)
6) Q:Dimitris: Why did we leave out Routes in RouteConfig?
7) Enter USERS only by hand with password abc123!@# for ease.
8)Never delete the migrations. If you have to modify my books make sure you run migrations afterwards to 
 bring synthetic data to its proper form. We have't any data annotations yet so I chose the seed carefully.
9)The only thing inside local db when we pass the project to each other will be my seed, and users that 
 you will add by hand. If you add books/authors/genres/publishers for testing purposes, 
 you will DELETE them ALL before passing the project to the next person. ALLIWS GINOMASTE MPOYRDELO.
10) I tried to do something novel with Shop by navbar. DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING. It's not working
   as i'd like to but it's good enough. So we're moving on to basket/orders.
